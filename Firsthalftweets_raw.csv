@Mrsweaty0,Ben has no mobility at least a backup would be able to run if he can‚Äôt pass the ball,1h
@Humble_____,@steelers #Steelers is making me want to drink myself to a coma.,1h
@Andy1760,Cmon I neeeeed Steelers to make a comeback!!,1h
@my_diamondx,Good to see Steelers are playing the exact same plays that didn't work all year. And wth Johnson? Was doing great for a while but back to dropping every damn pass.,1h
@Ramirez36893472,Los steelers van perdiendo,1h
@baldoguerra,Ya nos carg√≥ la v! #Steelers,1h
@MusicCityMedia,At least the @steelers defense will get a rest at halftime. They‚Äôll need it because they‚Äôll have to be on the field to start the second half since Tomlin took the ball first instead of deferring.,1h
@Michael34269478,I agree the Steelers do not belong in this game. Their defense is now on the field way to long. The Chiefs have scored 50+ points in 2 games in the first half. Pathetic Tomlin. Well thanks for all the great seasons Ben,1h
@BFrohman,@steelers y‚Äôall butt.,1h
@fckstaylor,"o que me deixa PUTA com o steelers √© que a defesa se segura muito bem mas o ataque n√£o √© nem razo√°vel, ele √© uma MERDA. se fosse pelo menos mediano j√° dava pra ser um time competitivo. a defesa n√£o faz milagre sozinha",1h
@tmorrow25,This Offense is Putrid!,1h
@peg2584,21-7‚Ä¶okay,1h
@BRecJR,"Steelers WRs got frying pans for hands tonight. Defense standing on their heads. Loved the start, hated the finish of the first half. A lot of football to play. DO IT FOR 7 #HereWeGo",1h
@FrangibleRocker,Halftime. I think Ben Roethlisberger may agree with my assessment.,1h
@BLee_CLT,Get a qb,1h
@JScottShep,"Got it. He‚Äôll be cut. Washington, Steelers, Panthers, possibly Giants? Might be a placeholder for a rook.",1h
@homeindaburgh,Put Rudolph in #HereWeGo @steelers,1h
@cpitt2025,"@stephenasmith u want to talk about the @dallascowboys damn man, your @steelers haven't even made it to the 50 yard line yet on offense buddy.",1h
@longlivesteeez,@steelers could you tell the offense they are playing a football game ?,1h
@thomasggraef,"Vaca em cima do poste Tartaruga em cima da √°rvore Pittsburgh Steelers nos Playoffs Ningu√©m sabe como chegaram l√°, mas todo mundo sabe que logo v√£o cair #NFL",1h
@Uncle_Fooby,@scarpizio This is the Steelers‚Äô 18th game. Any idea how many games the team scored an offensive TD in the first half?,1h
@gabbiedeb,CMON MAN !!!Steelers you can do this !!!! Help Ben !!!!!!!!!,1h
@cb_laflare,Copy and paste. Just seen a cowboy fan say the same thing,1h
@gosteelers9043,It hurts everywhere #HereWeGo #steelers #PITvsKC #NflPlayoffs #Nfltwitter #Chiefs #ChiefsKingdom,1h
@matt_brown49,The only thing worse than watching the Steelers get blown out is listening to Cris Collinsworth talk about the Steelers getting blown out,1h
@politicaljimbo,Looks like a road trip. No way that Steelers offense is coming back.,1h
@emanatee,"Sorry, they lost 8 games each. Steelers made the playoffs with a weird team and it made everyone mad for some reason.",1h
@dahlman_w,Steelers offense hasn‚Äôt been great at all this season,1h
@Six__Four_Three,Now #2 even more shaky. Steelers just don't have the horsepower to keep up with KC offense. Even with KC turning it over twice in the First half.,1h
@DallasGrey3,The best offense the Steelers have had in the first half‚Ä¶,1h
@boydmyers,Steelers couldn‚Äôt score 31 if KC had only 3 defensive players.,1h
@miguel_nerio_,"Muy complicado aguantar a la ofensiva de Kansas, s√∫male los errores de la ofensiva de Steelers.",1h
@JRown32,TJ Watt's fumble return: 26 yards #Steelers total offense: 44 yards,1h
@CrissHardyy,"Impresentable la ofensiva de #Steelers , Big Ben dando l√°stima, lo usual en su carrera, vive de un SB. Esa gran defensiva merece un QB decente, hasta Tim Teabow, Romo, o el QB m√°s malo que me digan, tirar√≠a pases m√°s decentes. Felicidades a Pittsburgh que por fin se retira....",1h
@TheAngryYinzer,The steelers better wake up the second half.,1h
@DakotaSheipe,Holding and the Steelers offense not getting any calls in there favor,1h
@Albert101366,Back to normal. When the defense spends the whole time on the field because the offense is horrible for the #Steelers #SteelersNation this is what happens.,1h
@SPTO,At least the Steelers kept it close for a while....The 2nd half could be a long one for Steelers fans.,1h
@hardy_dickerson,Can ppl stop drinking the #Tomlin koolaid ‚Ä¶#Herewego #Steelers who cares if he goes 8-8 he hasn‚Äôt won shit in a long long time,1h
@corvanta,We suck,1h
@shelovejaii,Fr. 21-7 LFG!,1h
@Gigigirld88,It‚Äôs fixed. The no calls for holding on the offensive line is obvious the NFL wants the Chiefs in the playoffs not the Steelers. Clearly the abominable officiating this weekend is clear to how the NFL and Roger already have their Super Bowl winner,1h
@Relyks76,"Hey. At least Mike Tomlin gave you all another great quote before the game. Good news is no one is blinking watching this game, everyone is closing their eyes to avoid the trauma. #HereWeGo #Steelers",1h
@MontelongoAlan,"De hecho, nada m√°s los hicieron enojar. Kansas estaba rifado una verguiza, y Steelers compr√≥ todos los boletos.",1h
@IceColdJones_,Chiefs really would‚Äôve been in trouble if the Steelers even had a tiny bit of offensive ability. So hard to watch,1h
@AirChitownJSK23,The back to back afc champs are taking it to my @steelers rn! However I‚Äôm gonna still be there for them until the end especially since this may be the last time I ever see Big Ben at QB! #HereWeGo,1h
@klew24,"Tired: Gee willikers, that wildcat call that led to the Steelers TD was dumb as hell Wired: Chiefs have been kicking them boys in the teeth ever since.",1h
@Kevindtsonfan69,Mahomes better hope the Steelers pull off the comeback or we gone have some real issues,1h
@JohnnyGoodtimes,Eagles and Steelers both making the case that letting a 7th seed into the playoffs was a silly waste of time.,1h
@luzikinha,Eis que o trator j√° entrou em a√ß√£o em cima dos @steelers #NFLnaESPN #HereWeGo #ChiefsKingdom,1h
@J_Spigs33,If we were old yeller we would of been shot 7 weeks ago. We just want it to stop. #Steelers,1h
@ChiefUso,Their offense isn‚Äôt going to get it done. I feel like Reid didn‚Äôt want to show too much in the first quarter. After that TD by the Steelers he‚Äôs like eff this Let‚Äôs hammer these boys!,1h
@robowen88,@RequestABet Mckinnon 100+ rushing yards and 1+ TD in the Chiefs v Steelers game. Could I get that added?,1h
@CEOofMatt,At least the Steelers defense starts the 2nd half on the field so they have a chance to get points.,1h
@Steelers0867,"o line stinks, receiving corps stinks. only Muth and Najee should be untouchable heading into next season.",1h
@NfLatina,"Mahomes Magic Esto puede ser terminante para los Steelers, que tienen 45 yardas de ofensiva al entretiempo #Chiefskingdom arriba 21-7",1h
@_ThatOtherKidd,Get Ben outta there and I‚Äôll be a fan. I love Pittsburgh teams but I love to see the Steelers lose,1h
@BabyFaceLef,I want y'all to explain why y'all thought the Steelers had a shot.,1h
