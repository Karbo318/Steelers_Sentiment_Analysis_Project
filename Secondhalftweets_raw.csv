@Bscha4a,Say what you want about the Steelers! Ben said it perfectly in his interview this past week. “We’re probably not suppose to be here” they are oh well you win some you lose some haters gunna hate lol Big Ben thank you for the last 18 years! #HereWeGo,16m

@Kyle_Roberts_15,My original tweet was they aren’t competing. Steelers best option this 2021 season was to keep Ben but we all knew they weren’t competing with the Chiefs or Bills or whoever. Okay Baker is the best option THIS year (maybe) doesn’t mean you’re accomplishing anything,1h

@WillReeveJr,"This is not a good Steelers team. Say what you will, but Big Ben has shown that he is still good enough to win. Some of these late game passes are top tier, including that last TD to Washington. Pittsburgh dramatically overachieved to get to this point, and Ben is not the problem",1h
@haydendamico,James Washington arguably has the best hands on the team and has sat the bench all year. Steelers first offseason move needs to be apologizing out the ass and beg him to sign an extension with us. If the Steelers let him go it’ll be one of the biggest mistakes they could make.,1h
@SportsTalkDrew,I played as many playoff games as Joe,1h
@StevenTSteven1,Psst.. Steelers #7 > Brookdale Mt. Lebanon. Call them. Maybe?,1h
@Wisecat007,Absolutely agree! I said the exact same thing earlier in the season. Not sure what he did to get in the dog house. I’m sure he’ll do good wherever he ends up.,1h
@holgazan_Mau87,"Diría que los Steelers le ganaron a los Broncos de manera inexplicable, pero no tanto porque también, como dice Franco Escamilla, está la piedra pa'l chingadazo, ese partido lo iba a ganar el menos malo de los dos.",1h

@kinche27,Great catch @JamesWashington,1h
@ericmartian,the #steelers scored more points than all the other wildcard losers #statthat @ToneDigz @nickmaraldo,1h
@MEGABUCBUC,That first quarter was good to watch though wasn’t it. #Steelers,1h
@Awallace008,"Matt Canada has a hard on for ray ray and 2 yard passes. When Ben starts calling the plays Washington gets involved cause of his jump ball skills. Fire Matt, let Ben retire and hire him as OC",1h
@chris_neff_pgh,The #Steelers WR corp stinks.,1h
@Tonino_70,La verdad es que Kansas city A la ofensiva es un pinché equipazo . Que madriza nos están metiendo #HereWeGo #NoAflojen #Steelers,1h
@Losthetaurus,@steelers,1h
@DOMISMONEY,"Any common sense Steelers fan knows this season has been absolutely hilarious and brilliant. No way does this team deserve to be in the playoffs, but yet they still made it. The Browns had Super Bowl aspirations and ended up missing the playoffs and had a losing record",1h
@rays_chris13,"He is gonna go to a team that will actually use him next year, and it's going to hurt to see how stupid the Steelers are for not using him more",1h
Steelers/PensFan@CathieStraka,We're all upset & embarrassed at the Steelers terrible showing tonight. It happens. Just be thankful for our past successes and not act like spoiled babies. Chill.,1h
@nukelaloosh11,@steelers onside kick AYFKM right now? Why didn’t you care in the first half!? What DF is wrong with this team????,1h
@KiyoLawliet,The steelers really tried to onside to us huh,1h
@swoody372,when you throw the ball past the line of scrimmage,1h
@SnoodlePop24,TE’s throwing TD’s and lineman catching TD’s! That’s called being “toyed with”,1h
@ChopChop570,Looking forward to draft SZN with ya my boy. Gunna be interesting what we and the team think is priority..,1h
@loosecanons_,"if we're going back and changing the season, let's just make the ravens healthy! almost def no steelers + lamar in the playoffs.",1h
@dakotaisahimbo,I dislike being a Steelers fan.,1h
@treed1919,No idea what’s going on with Steelers offense in terms of James Washington and his usage. Guy seems to make some contested catches and then disappears for weeks at a time.,1h
@deck_thompson,Touchdown Steelers!! #SteelersNation #Nflplayoffs,1h
@DrHistoryBrad,Sweetie you never even sniffed the playoffs and this Steelers team swept your sorry-ass team. Sit down.,1h
@realmrpibb,"Raiders, too. Don’t forget the Raiders. I do wish we were doing this to them instead…for the 3rd time this year.",1h
@Jfrasher76,I want to go back to when he came in for Tommy and went 13-0 as a rookie so I can watch it all agin.,1h
@AndreJJohnson9,As much as I want new OC/DC Coordinators…..it’s not always Coach T’s decision….GM and Owners have a say too…#Steelers,1h
@16colosimoj,I think you’re insecure that you never beat the Steelers,1h
@Zakreee,The NFL sets up these ratings & star watch games it’s annoying to me No 3x a charm matchups no Bad matchups Shoulda been Bills vs Bengals KC vs patriots Raiders vs steelers We struggled thru bad AFC matchups for the sake of saving teams from playing hard,1h
@jesskhalifa,My fav part of Steelers games is beer and nachos,1h
@DarwinBroussard,They sure didn’t play like it lmao,1h
@FromINEZwLove,Let em know 85,1h
@AndyKolowich,"What good is NBC sports if they are showing a score of 28-7 in the Steelers game when I know it’s at least 44-14. Can’t wait for the Olympics, Not!! #nbcsports #nbcoylmpics",1h
@davidedwinross,"Hats off to us for kicking onside there, love to see it! #steelers",1h
@CJ_Simon86,Like how do you not give Lynch the ball,1h
@RagingBull_Stru,@joethomas73 talking shit on the steelers losing in the playoffs is comical since he doesn't know what playing in a playoff game feels like,1h
@joeybagovdonuts,Thank you Steelers for a greet season and thank you Ben for an amazing career!! #MyFinalWord,1h
@fombellman,"A Browns' fan who runs a pro-Browns media site developed a chart that claims that the Browns have been ""hurt"" most by officiating and their top rival (not really because rivals implies a competition) has been ""helped"" the most. I'm shocked at the findings of this ""report.""",1h
@BigBen7HOF,Gross. But there is a reason for it. #Steelers,1h
@OnTo74,Hope I’m wrong but I think the pirates have a better shot winning the World Series than the Steelers firing Matt Canada. They’re just too loyal,1h

@erikamtz29,Si ganan los steelers me pongo hacer ejercicio jajaja aesino,1h
@JeffTurek,Browns have one playoff win this century and got swept by the Steelers this year. If this is what you want to take your joy in the. have at it because not much else goes right for the mistake by the lake.,1h
@garrettkohrs12,y’all got a trophy for sweeping a bad team with an injured qb? like i don’t care bro. y’all gon be sub .500 for years to come after ben gone. last game the browns played the steelers in that actually mattered resulted in a first round exit for your pittsburgh steelers,1h
@JackStarbb12,His final throw will be a TD to win the super bowl.,1h
@StarboyAlien2,Steelers? New head coach?,1h
@BurnerTbs,His last td of a fraudulent career,1h
@BraydenFainV2,One of the Steelers worst years (9-7-1) in the past 18 years is the Bengals best season in 31 years. I don’t wanna hear anything lol.,1h

@DA24_tally,This exactly why I didn’t want the Steelers in the playoffs..chargers in the offs would’ve been more entertaining,1h

@frankzamorano11,Imagine how Ben feels right now. Your last time playing football ever and it's blow out.,1h
@ThriveFantasy,Washington with a nice snag for the Steelers TD! Perhaps Ben Roethlisberger’s last touchdown? @NFL | #SuperWildCard | #HereWeGo,1h
@tyraniboah89,"Feels like the Chargers, Colts, and Ravens would have been a better wild card field than Raiders, Patriots, and Steelers. Too bad I guess. I think the 7 seed is overall not a bad thing but it’s pretty telling that the Philip Rivers-led Colts have been the best 7 seed so far",1h
@NOKAP16430634,Dudes a loser clown ratio,1h
@eric__craft,"The Eagles beat ZERO playoff teams. The Steelers beat 2, one in the first week (most useless week of the season to gauge team success) against a Buffalo team that beats them by 40 today. Another against an injury riddled Titans team. Neither team should’ve been here.",1h
@gmikewebb,Now we should pull Ben so his last NFL pass was a TD. #steelers,1h
@Irradiccus,Remember when #steelers fans thought they had a shot at beating the chiefs? That was hilarious,1h

@thegusfring412,But he’s a loser. He’s got money. He’s got the house. He’s got the cars. But he’s a loser. His entire career as a complete and utter loser. All those consecutive snaps and never won. Was he worth all that money if all he did was help them lose?,1h
